# Programming Languages
Welcome to my personal programming playground!

This repository contains a collection of folders, each dedicated to a different programming language. My main goal with this project is to continuously learn, practice, and improve my skills across multiple languages, exploring their unique features, paradigms, and idiomatic approaches.

## What's inside?
The repository is organized into folders by language. Each folder contains practice problems, small projects, or experiments written in that particular language. Furthermore, inside there is a book used as a guide for each programming language (Taken from: https://books.goalkicker.com), and anyone can use it to delve deeper into any topic. Some of the languages currently included are:

- Java

(And more to come!)

## Purpose
This repository serves multiple purposes:

- Continuous learning and self-improvement.
- Exploring and experimenting with different languages and technologies.
- Sharing my journey and progress with others.
- Creating a reference I can revisit as I grow as a developer.
